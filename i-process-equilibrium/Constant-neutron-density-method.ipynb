    "The goal is to prescribe a method of configuring single-zone simulations that generate an equilibrium trans-Fe element abundance pattern for a prescribed, constant neutron density. With this method one can determine local elemental abundance ratios as a function of neutron density once equilibrium is reached, independent of neutron exposure.\n",

    "## General idea\n",
    "The idea has two parts. One is how to formulate the neutron source as a reaction that ensures a prescribed neutron density. The other involves a reaction from $\\mathsf{^{209}Bi}$ back to $\\mathsf{^{56}Fe}$ to ensure the former is not piling up and the latter is not depleted in the drive toward an equilibrium solution.\n",

    "## Neutron source\n",
    "The above equilibrium equation can be used to calculate the reaction rate  $\\mathsf{<\\sigma v>_{kl,n}}$ of the  neutron source as all other variables are known, including the prescribed neutron density  $\\mathsf{N_n}$. While the composition of the neutron absorbing species $N_\\mathrm{m}$ will vary a bit during the time step, and therefore $\\mathsf{<\\sigma v>_{kl,n}}$ should vary, this effect will vanish as equilibrium is approached. The same is true for $\\mathsf{<\\sigma v>_{kl,n}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the neutron source reaction rate $\\mathsf{<\\sigma v>_{kl,n}}$ as described above, we introduce an artificial neutron source reaction. We adopt two artificial species already defined in the `ppn_physics.input` sandbox, $\\mathsf{^1G}$ and $\\mathsf{^1L}$. This artificial neutron source is similar but just the reverse of the neutron sink introduced by [Herwig+ 03](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...593.1056H).\n",

This means that $\\mathsf{^{56}Fe}$ is the lightest neutron capture element and no leakage from lighter elements into the trans-Fe region is allowed. This is equivalent to saying that there is an unlimited (or very large) reservoir of Fe seeds, which is indeed a good approximation for the convective-reactive i-process sites."

In the solar abundance distribution it is $\\mathsf{2\\times10^{-5}}$. However, the absolute $\\mathsf{^{56}Fe}$ abundance is irrelevant in this equilibrium approach. In fact, it may be advisable to choose it substantially larger to mininmize round-off erros. Then, for the initial abundance of $\\mathsf{^1G}$ any number larger by some factor, maybe 10, will do."

No substantial amounts of $\\mathsf{^1L}$ will be replenished until the reaction flow reaches $\\mathsf{^{209}Bi}$. At that point the back reaction `Bi209  + n  -> Fe56 + 154L1` will replenish `L1` and the `L1` abundance will asymptotically approach a constant value `L1_final`, at which point the computation can be stopped and the equilibrium abundance has been established. \n",

    "## Alternative option: solve equilibrium equations\n",
    "What is described above is of course the time evolution towards an equilibrium solution. This could also be found by just solving the linear set of equations that derive from setting the left-hand side of all network equations above to zero, while ommitting equations for neutrons and setting $\\mathsf{N_n}$ to prescribed constant values. The back reaction and the artificial neutron source need to be included, of course. Technically this can be easily done by letting the `ppn` code write a `networksetup.txt` file for input T and $\\mathsf{\\rho}$ values, so that the rates for those conditions are written out. All unwanted reactions and species are set to `F`. One can then use the `networksetup.txt`  file as input, and solve in a separate Python program the linear set of equations. The result is an equilibrium abundance distribution. This may not be saving implementation time though. "

This is a github repository containing run files and analysis notebooks for the **TINA hub** on ``astrohub.uvic.ca``.


## TINA: Training In Nuclear Astrophysics
TINA is a JupyterHub for training in nuclear astrophysics provided by the [NSF Physics Frontier Center Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements](http://www.jinaweb.org). It is hosted on the virtual computational research environment [Astrohub](https://astrohub.uvic.ca) operated by the [Computational Stellar Astrophysics group](https://csa.phys.uvic.ca) in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.uvic.ca/science/physics) and the [Astronomy Research Center](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/arc) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca). 

## i-process, nova, xrb (X-ray burst), and ccsn (core-collapse supernova) one-zone nucleosynthesis simulations
See ``i-process/Readme.md``, ``nova/Readme.md``, ``xrb/Readme.md``, and ``ccsn/Readme.md`` files for more detailed information on the corresponding project module of TINA.

## About
TINA has been created by Falk Herwig and Pavel Denissenkov (NuGrid, UVic) and Hendrik Schatz (JINA-CEE, MSU). TINA has been used, for example in the JINA-CEE [PAN: Physics of Atomic Nuclei](https://www.jinaweb.org/educational-outreach/physics-atomic-nuclei-pan) program for highschool students.

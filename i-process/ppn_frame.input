! lines starting with ! are comments, "uncommenting a line" means
! removing the leading ! from that line, "commenting a line" means
! adding a ! to the beginning first character

! both lines, leaving the other two pairs commented.

! *** end of namelist

   ! the parameter values are given as fortran95 "namelists"
   ! here's a brief summary of how things work with namelists.
   ! each line in a namelist is of the form   name = value ! comment
   ! each name must be declared as a control in the program,
   ! but you don't need to include all of the controls in the list.
   ! and the order of the list doesn't matter.
   ! blank lines and comment lines can be freely included in the list.
   ! blanks at the start of a line containing a name-value pair are okay too.
   ! all of the controls are given reasonable default values at initialization.
   ! so you only need to set the ones that you actually want to change
   ! if you don't want to change a control, but you do want to keep in the list
   ! either comment out the line, or leave the value field blank.
   ! fortran supports structured values in namelists (arrays and derived types)
   ! but for simplicity, we only use basic types (integers, doubles, logicals, strings).
   ! values are given using the usual fortran syntax.
   ! for example, character string values are enclosed in quotes
   ! ****** REMINDER ******
   ! A '/' character terminates the namelist.
   ! So, do not use '/' outside of comments or strings.
   ! In particular, don't write something like 1d0/3d0 as a value.
